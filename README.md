# EEB319_PopulationEcology
Scripts and dependencies for U of T EEB's EEB319, Population Ecology, course.

A quick note on pathnames and environments:

This repo is set up such that, if you download the repo in its entirety and open the .Rproj, you should be able to run everything without issue. 

	⁃	Labs 1, 3, and 4 include images that are embedded via pathnames. All those images are in the following folders: Lab1_Images, Lab3_Images, and Lab4_Images. If you don’t re-arrange the repo, you shouldn’t encounter any problems. 
	⁃	In Lab 1, in line 114 of the .Rmd, we ask the students to import a .csv. That .csv is included in the repo as “ModelSimulation_r03.csv”. If you move this file, you’ll have to change the pathname in the Lab 1 .Rmd.
	⁃	Some labs contain code blocks within which we’ve set eval = FALSE. If you try to run some of these blocks, you’ll encounter errors, as those blocks call on objects we’re asking students to assign.
	⁃	In other labs, we’ve kept eval = TRUE, but have commented out the lines of code we’re asking students to work with.
